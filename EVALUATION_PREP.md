## Technical Decisions Deep Dive

### 1. Architecture Approach

**Decision**: Clean separation between frontend/backend with service-oriented architecture
```
Backend (FastAPI)                Frontend (React + TypeScript)
├── api/        (REST endpoints) ├── components/  (UI elements)
├── services/   (business logic) ├── services/    (API calls)
├── models/     (Pydantic DTOs)  ├── types/       (TypeScript interfaces)
└── core/       (config, utils)  └── hooks/       (state management)
```

**Why This Choice**:
- **Scalability**: Clear boundaries allow independent team development
- **Testability**: Service layer isolation enables comprehensive unit testing
- **Maintainability**: Follows .NET/Angular patterns I'm familiar with
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end typing from Python Pydantic to TypeScript

**Trade-offs Acknowledged**:
- More initial setup than monolithic approach
- Network overhead for API calls
- **Time investment justified**: Proper architecture paid off during 4-hour development

### 2. LLM Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Structured JSON prompts with robust parsing and fallback mechanisms

**Implementation Highlights**:
```python
# System prompt engineering for complex queries
def _build_system_prompt(self, csv_metadata: CSVMetadata) -> str:
    return f"""
    ADVANCED PATTERNS:
    1. Multi-dimensional grouping: "by region and product" → group_by: ["region", "product"]
    2. Calculated fields: "revenue" → calculate from units_sold * unit_price
    3. Time comparisons: "over time by region" → time extraction + grouping
    """
```

**Why This Approach**:
- **Reliability**: Structured responses reduce parsing errors
- **Complexity Handling**: Supports multi-dimensional queries beyond simple charts
- **Graceful Degradation**: Rule-based fallback when OpenAI unavailable
- **Safety**: No code execution, only pandas operations

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Malformed JSON responses → clarification prompts
- Missing columns → helpful error messages
- Ambiguous queries → suggested refinements
- API failures → local fallback responses

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Chart Support

**Problem Solved**: Questions like "show sales by region and product" need grouped visualization

**Technical Solution**:
```typescript
// Data reshaping for multi-series charts
const reshapeForMultiSeries = (data, xKey, yKey, groupKey) => {
  const grouped = new Map();
  rawData.forEach(item => {
    const xValue = String(item[xKey]);
    const groupValue = String(item[groupKey]);
    if (!grouped.has(xValue)) {
      grouped.set(xValue, { [xKey]: xValue });
    }
    grouped.get(xValue)[groupValue] = Number(item[yKey]);
  });
  return Array.from(grouped.values());
};
```

**Innovation**: Dynamic series key generation with color mapping for complex visualizations

### 4. Error Handling Philosophy

**Strategy**: Multi-layer validation with user-friendly feedback

**Implementation Layers**:
1. **Client Validation**: File type, size, format checks
2. **Server Validation**: CSV parsing, column validation
3. **LLM Fallback**: Rule-based responses for reliability
4. **UX Recovery**: Clear error messages with retry mechanisms

**Example Error Flow**:
```
User uploads invalid file → Clear message: "Only CSV files allowed"
LLM API fails → Fallback: "Here's a basic chart while AI is unavailable"
Ambiguous question → Clarification: "Did you mean sales by month or by region?"
```

## Key Problem-Solving Moments

### Challenge 1: Multi-Dimensional Data Grouping
**Situation**: Initial charts only supported single-dimension (e.g., "sales by region")  
**Problem**: Users wanted complex queries like "sales by region AND product"  
**Solution**: Enhanced chart service with group_by array and data reshaping logic  
**Result**: Supports unlimited grouping dimensions with proper visualization

### Challenge 2: LLM Response Reliability
**Situation**: OpenAI sometimes returned malformed JSON or missing fields  
**Problem**: Application crashes on invalid responses  
**Solution**: Robust parsing with validation layers and minimal spec fallback  
**Result**: Never crashes, always provides useful feedback to user

### Challenge 3: Revenue Calculation Intelligence
**Situation**: Users asking for "revenue" when CSV only has units_sold and unit_price  
**Problem**: LLM needs to understand calculated fields  
**Solution**: Enhanced prompts + automatic field calculation in chart service  
**Result**: Natural queries work even for derived metrics

### Challenge 4: Chat Context Management
**Situation**: Follow-up questions like "now show it by product too"  
**Problem**: LLM needs conversation history for context  
**Solution**: Context-aware prompts with previous Q&A history  
**Result**: Natural conversational flow for data exploration

## Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance

### Backend Test Coverage
```python
# Comprehensive LLM service testing
class TestLLMService:
    async def test_generate_chart_response_success(self):
        """Test successful LLM chart generation - happy path."""
    
    async def test_generate_chart_response_malformed_json(self):
        """Test handling of malformed LLM response - error recovery."""
    
    async def test_revenue_calculation_detection(self):
        """Test revenue calculation prompt enhancement - business logic."""
```

**Coverage Areas**:
